# Keep moving: identifying task-relevant subspaces to maximise plasticity for newly learned tasks

This repository contains code for the paper: "Keep moving: identifying task-relevant subspaces to maximise plasticity for newly learned tasks" (https://web3.arxiv.org/abs/2310.04741).

Code for producing data for figures 2-4 is organised in folders:

- Fig. 2: ./comparison_experiments
- Fig. 3: ./linear_experiments
- Fig. 4: ./nonlinear_experiments

Each figure can be reproduced from the corresponding .ipynb notebook in this repository.
